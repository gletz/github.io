github.io
=========
~~Just a hapless beginner here, trying to get the lay of the land and publish my initial github page. Nothing to see here folks, move along.~~

This page was published with github's autogenerator. The autogenerator is a page of instructions and buttons, in a step-by-step wizard format, that show you how to publish a github page. But the instructions end up being the page you generate. It's OK. I guess the idea is now to change it.
