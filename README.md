github.io
=========
~~Just a hapless beginner here, trying to get the lay of the land and publish my initial github page. Nothing to see here folks, move along.~~

This page was published with github's autogenerator. The autogenerator is a page of instructions and buttons, in a step-by-step wizard format, that show you how to publish a github page. But the instructions end up being the page you generate. It's OK. I guess the idea is now to change it. 

###Background###
I'm a designer who began as a graphic designer with a BFA from UW in Seattle when it was a five-year program and there was no such thing as desktop publishing, let alone the internet. I came to UW after nearly four years of university studies in Montana, split almost evenly between chemical engineering and fine art, with a smattering of anthropology, psychology, linguistics, and philosophy. 

After beginning my career as a traditional print designer I was lucky enough to find my way to San Francisco at a time when design and computers were about to converge. Many designers fell out of the field because of this convergence, but for me it was a catalyst. Where before there had been a premium on how well you could draw, now there was a premium on how well you could think. In short, I worked for some prestigious firms on some prestigious projects and went from being a graphic deigner to a user-interface designer, an information designer, and a product designer.
