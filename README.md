~~Just a hapless beginner here, trying to get the lay of the land and publish my initial github page. Nothing to see here folks, move along.~~

This page was published with github's autogenerator. The autogenerator is a page of instructions and buttons, in a step-by-step wizard format, that show you how to publish a github page. But the instructions end up being the page you generate. It's OK. I guess the idea is now to change it. 

###Background###
I began my career as a graphic designer at a time when there was no such thing as desktop publishing, let alone cell phones, tablets, or even the internet. I graduated from the UW in Seattle with a BFA in graphic design. It was a five-year program based on Swiss style design as taught at Basel and Yale. I had come to UW after nearly four years of university studies in Montana, split almost evenly between chemical engineering and fine art, with a smattering of anthropology, psychology, linguistics, and philosophy. All told, it took me seven years.

After a brief period doing traditional print design in Dallas and New Mexico, I was lucky enough to find my way to San Francisco at a time when design and computers were about to converge. Many designers fell out of the field because of this convergence, but for me it was a catalyst. Where before there had been a premium on how well you could draw, now there was a premium on how well you could think. In short, I worked for some prestigious firms on some prestigious projects and went from being a graphic designer to a user-interface designer, an information designer, and a product designer.  

In 1995, I returned to Seattle to accept a job offer from Microsoft, where I worked for seven years, most of them as a product designer in the Office group. Working at Microsoft was a soul sucking experience. While it was a dream to work on products used by millions of people every day, the reality was that those same millions of users made Microsoft paralyzed to design anything new by a combination of fear and complacency. After seven years of disillusionment I simply had to leave. So I resigned. As it turned out, that was the end of the first round of my design career. 

After Microsoft I just needed time to get my feet back on the ground. So I checked out for a while. I bought a small business and ran it, again, for seven years, until I sold it in 2010. 

Now I'm trying to start the second round of my design career: I'll call it GLetzDesign 2.0. Maybe that's what this project is. There've been other projects, and this isn't my first effort at GLetzDesign 2.0 (see [GLetzDesign: 21 Projects](http://www.gletzdesign.com/)), but the launch party hasn't happened yet. 

I'm not complaining or wondering why. I know I've been away a long time and there's been no new work in my portfolio. And I had not been maintaining a portfolio while I was at Microsoft. So that's what *21 Projects* was about; bringing a lot of old work back to life and making a webpage to display it. The webpage itself would serve to demonstrate current coding and design abilities. But I realize there needs to be more. 

I've been told I should work on imaginary projects, and I have. At first I struggled to come up with a good imaginary project. Then I got an idea for a big project and worked on it for many months. I finally decided it was too big to simply put in my portfolio, and that it was actually an idea for a start-up company that should be protected before it is presented. (More about that project later perhaps.)

The point is that now I simply need to find work. I've been applying online for a long time and my resume always gets a lot of attention, but it doesn't lead anywhere. There are many job titles I feel I'm qualified for: graphic designer - junior or senior, user experience designer, interaction designer, user interface designer, web designer, etc. I've appied for all of these and have read a lot of job ads and I know the specific kinds of things employers are looking for, so it should be easy to just whip up some of that stuff and throw it online and get a job, right? 

Well, it hasn't been that easy. One big challenge is focus. It's difficult to pick one thing at a time and stay focused on finishing it when there is such a wide range of things to be worked on. Yet, I don't want to pigeonhole myself; one of my strongest attributes is my broad skillset as opposed to any particular skill. I find that looking at a problem from many different angles promotes synthesis and creativity. Another challenge in working on imagnary projects is taking yourself either too seriously or not seriously enough. If you're too serious it can kill your muse. If you're not serious enough you can become proud of things that shouldn't escape your sketch pad. The portfolio presentation itself can also be issue. It's too easy to get hung up on the design of the portfolio page itself, and this in turn can lead to being overly critical of the new work you're doing. It really needs to feel more like a sketching process than a new product rollout. 

I don't want my next job to be about job titles, roles and deliverables. I think it's important for any kind of designer to maintain a sense of being a maker, someone who isn't detached from the construction of the project, whether it be code, nuts and bolts, or paste-up and prepress. It's important to be involved throughout the process rather than being constrained or assigned to just a section or phase.

That's why I've recently become more excited about writing code than I've ever been. I think it's also because writing code is more fun than it's ever been. It's easier and more powerful than ever before, and the internet has become the lingua franca of modern civilization. It's really an exciting time to be a designer again, and I want back in!

I'm not sure how much of a developer I'll ever become, but I'm currently trying to learn as much JavaScript as I can (as well, of course, as HTML and CSS). I'm just amazed at how easy it is to do some really incredible stuff with JavaScript. At least that's how it seems to me after having to struggle for so long during my career learning one clumsy and under-powered language or system after another. So I've been attending local meet-ups to learn JavaScript, and that exposed me to GitHub. As a designer, the use of a version control system is not native to my craft. So, at first, the whole concept of what GitHub is and how I could apply it to my needs was elusive to me, but I had a sense it would be important to figure out.
